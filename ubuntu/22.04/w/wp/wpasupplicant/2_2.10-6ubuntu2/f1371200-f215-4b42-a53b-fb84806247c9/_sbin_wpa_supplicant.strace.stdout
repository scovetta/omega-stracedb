This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)

usage:
  wpa_supplicant [-BddhKLqqstuvW] [-P<pid file>] [-g<global ctrl>] \
        [-G<group>] \
        -i<ifname> -c<config file> [-C<ctrl>] [-D<driver>] [-p<driver_param>] \
        [-b<br_ifname>] [-e<entropy file>] [-f<debug file>] \
        [-o<override driver>] [-O<override ctrl>] \
        [-N -i<ifname> -c<conf> [-C<ctrl>] [-D<driver>] \
        [-m<P2P Device config file>] \
        [-p<driver_param>] [-b<br_ifname>] [-I<config file>] ...]

drivers:
  nl80211 = Linux nl80211/cfg80211
  wext = Linux wireless extensions (generic)
  wired = Wired Ethernet driver
  macsec_linux = MACsec Ethernet driver for Linux
  none = no driver (RADIUS server/WPS ER)
options:
  -b = optional bridge interface name
  -B = run daemon in the background
  -c = Configuration file
  -C = ctrl_interface parameter (only used if -c is not)
  -d = increase debugging verbosity (-dd even more)
  -D = driver name (can be multiple drivers: nl80211,wext)
  -e = entropy file
  -f = log output to debug file instead of stdout
  -g = global ctrl_interface
  -G = global ctrl_interface group
  -h = show this help text
  -i = interface name
  -I = additional configuration file
  -K = include keys (passwords, etc.) in debug output
  -L = show license (BSD)
  -m = Configuration file for the P2P Device interface
  -N = start describing new interface
  -o = override driver parameter for new interfaces
  -O = override ctrl_interface parameter for new interfaces
  -p = driver parameters
  -P = PID file
  -q = decrease debugging verbosity (-qq even less)
  -s = log output to syslog instead of stdout
  -t = include timestamp in debug messages
  -T = record to Linux tracing in addition to logging
       (records all messages regardless of debug verbosity)
  -u = enable DBus control interface
  -v = show version
  -W = wait for a control interface monitor before starting
example:
  wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
