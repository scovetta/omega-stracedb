    -is <store>          	Unsupported - Specifies the issuer's certificate store name.
    -iv <pvkFile>        	Unsupported - Specifies the issuer's .pvk private key file.
    -iy <type>           	Unsupported - Specifies the issuer's CryptoAPI provider type. For information about the CryptoAPI provider type, see the –sy option.
    -l <link>            	Unsupported - Links to policy information (for example, to a URL).
    -len <number>        	Specifies the generated key length, in bits.

    -sp <provider>       	Unsupported - Specifies the subject's CryptoAPI provider name, which must be defined in the registry subkeys of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider. If both –sp and –sy are present, the type of the CryptoAPI provider must correspond to the Type value of the provider's subkey.
    -sv <pvkFile>        	Unsupported - Specifies the subject's .pvk private key file. The file is created if none exists.
