piper-convert: Validate and convert Piper request and response messages

    Usage: piper-convert [-i <informat>] [-o <outformat>] request
           piper-convert [-i <informat>] [-o <outformat>] response

    where
       <informat>: the format to read from stdin
           ("json" or "capnp", default is "json")
       <outformat>: the format to convert to and write to stdout
           ("json", "json-b64" or "capnp", default is "json")
       request|response: whether messages are Vamp request or response type

If <informat> and <outformat> differ, convert from <informat> to <outformat>.
If <informat> and <outformat> are the same, just check validity of incoming
messages and pass them to output.

Specifying "json-b64" as output format forces base64 encoding for process and
feature blocks, unlike the "json" output format which uses text encoding.
The "json" input format accepts either.
