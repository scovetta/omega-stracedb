htcacheclean -- program for cleaning the disk cache.
Usage: htcacheclean [-Dvtrn] -pPATH [-lLIMIT] [-LLIMIT] [-PPIDFILE]
       htcacheclean [-nti] -dINTERVAL -pPATH [-lLIMIT] [-LLIMIT] [-PPIDFILE]
       htcacheclean [-Dvt] -pPATH URL ...

Options:
  -d   Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning every INTERVAL minutes.
       This option is mutually exclusive with the -D, -v and -r
       options.

  -D   Do a dry run and don't delete anything. This option is mutually
       exclusive with the -d option. When doing a dry run and deleting
       directories with -t, the inodes reported deleted in the stats
       cannot take into account the directories deleted, and will be
       marked as an estimate.

  -v   Be verbose and print statistics. This option is mutually
       exclusive with the -d option.

  -r   Clean thoroughly. This assumes that the Apache web server is 
       not running. This option is mutually exclusive with the -d
       option and implies -t.

  -n   Be nice. This causes slower processing in favour of other
       processes.

  -t   Delete all empty directories. By default only cache files are
       removed, however with some configurations the large number of
       directories created may require attention.

  -p   Specify PATH as the root directory of the disk cache.

  -P   Specify PIDFILE as the file to write the pid to.

  -R   Specify amount to round sizes up to.

  -l   Specify LIMIT as the total disk cache size limit. Attach 'K',
       'M' or 'G' to the number for specifying KBytes, MBytes or
        GBytes.

  -L   Specify LIMIT as the total disk cache inode limit. 'K', 'M' or
       'G' suffix can also be used.

  -i   Be intelligent and run only when there was a modification of
       the disk cache. This option is only possible together with the
       -d option.

  -a   List the URLs currently stored in the cache. Variants of the
       same URL will be listed once for each variant.

  -A   List the URLs currently stored in the cache, along with their
       attributes in the following order: url, header size, body size,
       status, entity version, date, expiry, request time,
       response time, body present, head request.

Should an URL be provided on the command line, the URL will be
deleted from the cache. A reverse proxied URL is made up as follows:
http://<hostname>:<port><path>?[query]. So, for the path "/" on the
host "localhost" and port 80, the URL to delete becomes
"http://localhost:80/?". Note the '?' in the URL must always be
specified explicitly, whether a query string is present or not.
