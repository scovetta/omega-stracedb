Usage: /usr/bin/esnacc [-h] [-P] [-t] [-v] [-e] [-d] [-p] [-f] [-y] [-M] [-B] 
            [-c | -C | -T <table output file> | -idl ]
            [-I <include directory>]
            [-mm] [-mf <max file name length>]
            [-l <neg number>]
            [-VDAexport=DEFINE_NAME] to designate export of SNACC generated classes
            [-E BER|DER select encoding rules to generate (C only)]
            [-a <start number>] select starting number for ANYs
            <ASN.1 file list>

  -c   generate C encoders and decoders (default)
  -C   generate C++ encoders and decoders
  -T <filename> write a type table file for the ASN.1 modules to file filename
  -O <filename> writes the type table file in the original (<1.3b2) format
  -B   turns off generation of constrained PER classes
  -idl generate CORBA IDL
  -h   prints this msg
  -P   print the parsed ASN.1 modules to stdout from their parse trees
       (helpful debugging)
  -t   generate type definitions
  -v   generate value definitions (limited)
  -e   generate encode routines
  -d   generate decode routines
  -p   generate print routines
  -f   generate hierarchical free routines (C only)
    Note: if none of -t -v -e -d -p -f are given, all are generated.
    These do not affect type tables.
  -y   enable bison debugging
  -M   uses the 1990 Syntax, default is the 1997 Syntax
  -mm  mangle output file name into module name (by default, the output file
       inherits the input file's name, with only the suffix replaced)
  -mf <num> num is maximum file name length for the generated source files
  -mo <directory> store output in the directory specified by <directory>.
  -l <neg num> where to start error longjmp values decending from (obscure).
  -L <error log file> print syntax errors to the specified error log file
                      (default is stderr)

Use `-' as the ASN.1 source file name to parse stdin.

This ASN.1 compiler produces C or C++ BER encoders and decoders or type tables.
