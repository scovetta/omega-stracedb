Usage:
    jmap -clstats <pid>
        to connect to running process and print class loader statistics
    jmap -finalizerinfo <pid>
        to connect to running process and print information on objects awaiting finalization
    jmap -histo[:live] <pid>
        to connect to running process and print histogram of java object heap
        if the "live" suboption is specified, only count live objects
    jmap -dump:<dump-options> <pid>
        to connect to running process and dump java heap
    jmap -? -h --help
        to print this help message

    dump-options:
      live         dump only live objects; if not specified,
                   all objects in the heap are dumped.
      format=b     binary format
      file=<file>  dump heap to <file>
      parallel=<number>  parallel threads number for heap iteration:
                         parallel=0 default behavior, use predefined number of threads
                         parallel=1 disable parallel heap iteration
                         parallel=<N> use N threads for parallel heap iteration

    Example: jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=heap.bin <pid>
