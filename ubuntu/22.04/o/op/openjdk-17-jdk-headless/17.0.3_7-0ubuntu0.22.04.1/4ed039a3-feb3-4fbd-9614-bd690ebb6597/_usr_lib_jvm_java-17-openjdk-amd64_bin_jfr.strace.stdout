Tool for working with Flight Recorder files

Before using this tool, you must have a recording file.
A file can be created by starting a recording from command line:

 java -XX:StartFlightRecording:filename=recording.jfr,duration=30s ... 

A recording can also be started on already running Java Virtual Machine:

 jcmd (to list available pids)
 jcmd <pid> JFR.start

Recording data can be dumped to file using the JFR.dump command:

 jcmd <pid> JFR.dump filename=recording.jfr

The contents of the recording can then be printed, for example:

 jfr print recording.jfr

 jfr print --events CPULoad,GarbageCollection recording.jfr

 jfr print --json --events CPULoad recording.jfr

 jfr print --categories 'GC,JVM,Java*' recording.jfr

 jfr print --events 'jdk.*' --stack-depth 64 recording.jfr

 jfr summary recording.jfr

 jfr metadata recording.jfr

 jfr metadata --categories GC,Detailed

For more information about available commands, use 'jfr help'
