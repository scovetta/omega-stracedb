Required parameter(s) missing or invalid.
usage: /usr/share/zfs/zfs-tests/bin/stride_dd -i inputfile -o outputfile -b blocksize -c count 
           -s stride [ -k seekblocks]

Simplified version of dd that supports the stride option.
A stride of n means that for each block written, n - 1 blocks
are skipped in both the input and output file. A stride of 1
means that blocks are read and written consecutively.
All numeric parameters must be integers.

    inputfile:  File to read from
    outputfile: File to write to
    blocksize:  Size of each block to read/write
    count:      Number of blocks to read/write
    stride:     Read/write a block then skip (stride - 1) blocks
    seekblocks: Number of blocks to skip at start of output
