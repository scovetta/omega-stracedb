Please specify the size of the environment partition.
mkenvimage [-h] [-r] [-b] [-p <byte>] -s <environment partition size> -o <output> <input file>

This tool takes a key=value input file (same as would a `printenv' show) and generates the corresponding environment image, ready to be flashed.

	The input file is in format:
		key1=value1
		key2=value2
		...
	Empty lines are skipped, and lines with a # in the first
	column are treated as comments (also skipped).
	-r : the environment has multiple copies in flash
	-b : the target is big endian (default is little endian)
	-p <byte> : fill the image with <byte> bytes instead of 0xff bytes
	-V : print version information and exit

If the input file is "-", data is read from standard input
