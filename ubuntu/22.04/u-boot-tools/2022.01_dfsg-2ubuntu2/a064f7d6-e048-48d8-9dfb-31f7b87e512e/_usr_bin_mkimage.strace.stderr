Error: Missing output filename
Usage: /usr/bin/mkimage -l image
          -l ==> list image header information
       /usr/bin/mkimage [-x] -A arch -O os -T type -C comp -a addr -e ep -n name -d data_file[:data_file...] image
          -A ==> set architecture to 'arch'
          -O ==> set operating system to 'os'
          -T ==> set image type to 'type'
          -C ==> set compression type 'comp'
          -a ==> set load address to 'addr' (hex)
          -e ==> set entry point to 'ep' (hex)
          -n ==> set image name to 'name'
          -d ==> use image data from 'datafile'
          -x ==> set XIP (execute in place)
       /usr/bin/mkimage [-D dtc_options] [-f fit-image.its|-f auto|-F] [-b <dtb> [-b <dtb>]] [-E] [-B size] [-i <ramdisk.cpio.gz>] fit-image
           <dtb> file is used with -f auto, it may occur multiple times.
          -D => set all options for device tree compiler
          -f => input filename for FIT source
          -i => input filename for ramdisk file
          -E => place data outside of the FIT structure
          -B => align size in hex for FIT structure and header
Signing / verified boot options: [-k keydir] [-K dtb] [ -c <comment>] [-p addr] [-r] [-N engine]
          -k => set directory containing private keys
          -K => write public keys to this .dtb file
          -G => use this signing key (in lieu of -k)
          -c => add comment in signature node
          -F => re-sign existing FIT image
          -p => place external data at a static position
          -r => mark keys used as 'required' in dtb
          -N => openssl engine to use for signing
       /usr/bin/mkimage -V ==> print version information and exit
Use '-T list' to see a list of available image types
