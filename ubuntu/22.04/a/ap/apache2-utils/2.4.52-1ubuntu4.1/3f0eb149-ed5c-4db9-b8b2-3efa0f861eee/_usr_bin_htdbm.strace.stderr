htdbm -- program for manipulating DBM password databases.

Usage: htdbm   [-cimBdpstvx] [-C cost] [-TDBTYPE] database username
                -b[cmBdptsv] [-C cost] [-TDBTYPE] database username password
                -n[imBdpst]  [-C cost] username
                -nb[mBdpst]  [-C cost] username password
                -v[imBdps]   [-C cost] [-TDBTYPE] database username
                -vb[mBdps]   [-C cost] [-TDBTYPE] database username password
                -x                     [-TDBTYPE] database username
                -l                     [-TDBTYPE] database
Options:
   -c   Create a new database.
   -n   Don't update database; display results on stdout.
   -b   Use the password from the command line rather than prompting for it.
   -i   Read password from stdin without verification (for script usage).
   -m   Force MD5 encryption of the password (default).
   -B   Force BCRYPT encryption of the password (very secure).
   -C   Set the computing time used for the bcrypt algorithm
        (higher is more secure but slower, default: 5, valid: 4 to 31).
   -d   Force CRYPT encryption of the password (8 chars max, insecure).
   -s   Force SHA encryption of the password (insecure).
   -p   Do not encrypt the password (plaintext, insecure).
   -T   DBM Type (SDBM|GDBM|DB|default).
   -l   Display usernames from database on stdout.
   -v   Verify the username/password.
   -x   Remove the username record from database.
   -t   The last param is username comment.
The SHA algorithm does not use a salt and is less secure than the MD5 algorithm.
