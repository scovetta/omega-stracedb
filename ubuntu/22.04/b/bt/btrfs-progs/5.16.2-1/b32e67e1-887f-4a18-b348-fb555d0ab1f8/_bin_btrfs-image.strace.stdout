usage: btrfs-image [options] source target
	-r      	restore metadump image
	-c value	compression level (0 ~ 9)
	-t value	number of threads (1 ~ 32)
	-o      	don't mess with the chunk tree when restoring
	-s      	sanitize file names, use once to just use garbage, use twice if you want crc collisions
	-w      	walk all trees instead of using extent tree, do this if your extent tree is broken
	-m	   	restore for multiple devices
	-d	   	also dump data, conflicts with -w

	In the dump mode, source is the btrfs device and target is the output file (use '-' for stdout).
	In the restore mode, source is the dumped image and target is the btrfs device/file.
