	BusyBox is a multi-call binary that combines many common Unix
	utilities into a single executable.  The shell in this build
	is configured to run built-in utilities without $PATH search.
	You don't need to install a link to busybox for each utility.
	To run external program, use full path (/sbin/ip instead of ip).
