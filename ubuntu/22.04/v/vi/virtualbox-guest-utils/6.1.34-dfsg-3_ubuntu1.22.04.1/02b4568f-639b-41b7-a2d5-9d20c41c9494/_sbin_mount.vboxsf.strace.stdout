Usage: /sbin/mount.vboxsf [OPTIONS] NAME MOUNTPOINT
Mount the VirtualBox shared folder NAME from the host system to MOUNTPOINT.

  -w                    mount the shared folder writable (the default)
  -r                    mount the shared folder read-only
  -n                    do not create an mtab entry
  -s                    sloppy parsing, ignore unrecognized mount options
  -o OPTION[,OPTION...] use the mount options specified

Available mount options are:
     rw                 mount writable (the default)
     ro                 mount read only
     uid=UID            set the default file owner user id to UID
     gid=GID            set the default file owner group id to GID
     ttl=MILLIESECSONDS set the "time to live" for both the directory cache
                        and inode info.  -1 for kernel default, 0 disables it.
     dcachettl=MILLIES  set the "time to live" for the directory cache,
                        overriding the 'ttl' option.  Ignored if negative.
     inodettl=MILLIES   set the "time to live" for the inode information,
                        overriding the 'ttl' option.  Ignored if negative.
     maxiopages=PAGES   set the max host I/O buffers size in pages. Uses
                        default if zero.
     dirbuf=BYTES       set the directory enumeration buffer size in bytes.
                        Uses default size if zero.
     cache=MODE         set the caching mode for the mount.  Allowed values:
                          default: use the kernel default (strict)
                             none: no caching; may experience guest side
                                   coherence issues between mmap and read.
                           strict: no caching, except for writably mapped
                                   files (for guest side coherence)
                             read: read via the page cache; host changes
                                   may be completely ignored
                        readwrite: read and write via the page cache; host
                                   changes may be completely ignored and
                                   guest changes takes a while to reach the host
     dmode=MODE         override the mode of all directories to (octal) MODE
     fmode=MODE         override the mode of all regular files to (octal) MODE
     umask=UMASK        set the umask to (octal) UMASK
     dmask=UMASK        set the umask applied to directories only
     fmask=UMASK        set the umask applied to regular files only
     iocharset CHARSET  use the character set CHARSET for I/O operations
                        (default set is utf8)
     convertcp CHARSET  convert the folder name from CHARSET to utf8
