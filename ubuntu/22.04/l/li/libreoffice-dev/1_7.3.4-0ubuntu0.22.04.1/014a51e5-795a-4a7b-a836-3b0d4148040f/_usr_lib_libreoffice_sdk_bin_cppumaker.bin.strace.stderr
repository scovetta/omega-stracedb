Options:
    -O<path>   = path describes the root directory for the generated output.
                 The output directory tree is generated under this directory.
    -T<name>   = name specifies a type or a list of types. The output for this
      [t1;...]   type is generated. If no '-T' option is specified,
                 then output for all types is generated.
                 Example: 'com.sun.star.uno.XInterface' is a valid type.
    -L         = UNO type functions are generated lightweight, that means only
                 the name and typeclass are given and everything else is retrieved
                 from the type library dynamically. The default is that UNO type
                 functions provides enough type information for bootstrapping C++.
                 '-L' should be the default for external components.
    -C         = UNO type functions are generated comprehensive that means all
                 necessary information is available for bridging the type in UNO.
    -nD        = no dependent types are generated.
    -G         = generate only target files which does not exists.
    -Gc        = generate only target files which content will be changed.
    -X<file>   = extra types which will not be taken into account for generation.
