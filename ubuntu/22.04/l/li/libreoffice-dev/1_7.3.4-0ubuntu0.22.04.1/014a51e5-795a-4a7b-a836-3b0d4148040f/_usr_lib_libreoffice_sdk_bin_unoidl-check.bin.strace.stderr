Usage:

  unoidl-check [--ignore-unpublished] [<extra registries A>] <registry A> --
    [<extra registries B>] <registry B>

where each <registry> is either a new- or legacy-format .rdb file, a single .idl
file, or a root directory of an .idl file tree.  Check that each entity from
<registry A> is also present in <registry B> in a compatible form.
