-A a nickname of a CA certificate
-C a CRL filename corresponding to the preceding CA nickname
-O allowed HTTP methods for OCSP requests: get, post, all, random, get-unknown
   random means: randomly fail if request method is GET, POST always works
   get-unknown means: status unknown for GET, correct status for POST

If status for a cert from an unknown CA is requested, the cert from the
first -A parameter will be used to sign the unknown status response.
NSS database parameters are used only if OCSP parameters are used.
