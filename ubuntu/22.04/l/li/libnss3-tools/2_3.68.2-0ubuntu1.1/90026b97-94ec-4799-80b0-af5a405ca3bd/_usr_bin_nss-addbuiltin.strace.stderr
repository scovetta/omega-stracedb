nss-addbuiltin: you must specify exactly one of -t or -D or -C
nss-addbuiltin -t trust -n nickname [-i certfile] [-c] [-h]
	Read a der-encoded cert from certfile or stdin, and output
	it to stdout in a format suitable for the builtin root module.
	Example: nss-addbuiltin -n MyCA -t "C,C,C" -i myca.der >> certdata.txt
nss-addbuiltin -D -n label [-i certfile]
	Read a der-encoded cert from certfile or stdin, and output
	a distrust record.
	(-D is equivalent to -t p,p,p -c -h)
nss-addbuiltin -C -e crl-entry-number -n label [-i crlfile]
	Read a CRL from crlfile or stdin, and output
	a distrust record (issuer+serial).
	(-C implies -c -h)
-t trust        trust flags (cCTpPuw).
-n nickname     nickname to assign to builtin cert, or
                a label for the distrust record.
-c              exclude the certificate (only add a trust record)
-h              exclude hash from trust record
                    (useful to distrust any matching issuer/serial)
                    (not allowed when adding positive trust)
-e              a CRL entry number, as shown by "crlutil -S"
-i file         input file to read (default stdin)
                    (pipe through atob if the cert is b64-encoded)
-d timestamp    convert a timestamp to DER, and output.
                useful to fill server and email distrust fields
                Example: nss-addbuiltin -d 1561939200
                NOTE: The informed timestamp are interpreted as seconds
                since unix epoch.
                TIP: date -d "2019-07-01 00:00:00 UTC" +%s
