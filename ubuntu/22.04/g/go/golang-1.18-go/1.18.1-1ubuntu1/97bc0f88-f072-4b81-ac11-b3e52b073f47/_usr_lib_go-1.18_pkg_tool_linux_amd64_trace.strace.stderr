Usage of 'go tool trace':
Given a trace file produced by 'go test':
	go test -trace=trace.out pkg

Open a web browser displaying trace:
	go tool trace [flags] [pkg.test] trace.out

Generate a pprof-like profile from the trace:
    go tool trace -pprof=TYPE [pkg.test] trace.out

[pkg.test] argument is required for traces produced by Go 1.6 and below.
Go 1.7 does not require the binary argument.

Supported profile types are:
    - net: network blocking profile
    - sync: synchronization blocking profile
    - syscall: syscall blocking profile
    - sched: scheduler latency profile

Flags:
	-http=addr: HTTP service address (e.g., ':6060')
	-pprof=type: print a pprof-like profile instead
	-d: print debug info such as parsed events

Note that while the various profiles available when launching
'go tool trace' work on every browser, the trace viewer itself
(the 'view trace' page) comes from the Chrome/Chromium project
and is only actively tested on that browser.
