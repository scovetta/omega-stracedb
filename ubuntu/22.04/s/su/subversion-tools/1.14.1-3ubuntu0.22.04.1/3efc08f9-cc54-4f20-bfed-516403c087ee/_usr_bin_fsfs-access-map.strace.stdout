fsfs-access-map <file>

Reads strace of some FSFS-based tool from <file>, prints some stats
and writes a cluster access map to 'access.bmp' the current folder.
Each pixel corresponds to one 64kB cluster and every line to a rev
or packed rev file in the repository.  Turquoise and green indicate
1 and 2 hits, yellow to read-ish colors for up to 20, shares of
for up to 100 and black for > 200 hits.

A typical strace invocation looks like this:
strace -e trace=open,close,read,lseek -o strace.txt svn log ...
