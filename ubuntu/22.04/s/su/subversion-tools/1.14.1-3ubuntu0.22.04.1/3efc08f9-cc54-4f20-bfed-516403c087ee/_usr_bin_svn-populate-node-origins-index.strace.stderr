Usage: /usr/bin/svn-populate-node-origins-index REPOS-PATH

Crawl the Subversion repository located at REPOS-PATH in an attempt to
populate that repository's index of node origins.  

The node origins index is new as of Subversion 1.5, and behaves as a
cache to vastly speed up certain history-querying operations.  For
compatibility with repositories created with pre-1.5 versions of
Subversion, Subversion will gracefully handle cache misses by doing a
brute-force calculation of the query answer and lazily populating the
index with answers it calculates.  Unfortunately, calculating that
information using the brute-force method (instead of having the
information appear in the index organically) can be very costly.

This tool triggers the lazy index population logic built into
Subversion in a fashion far more efficient than is likely to happen
during typical repository usage.  It can be run while the repository
is online, too, without interrupting normal Subversion activities.
