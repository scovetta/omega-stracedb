piper-vamp-simple-server: Load & run Vamp plugins in response to Piper messages

    Usage: piper-vamp-simple-server [-d] <format>
           piper-vamp-simple-server -v
           piper-vamp-simple-server -h

    where
       <format>: the format to read and write messages in ("json" or "capnp")
       -d, --debug: also print debug information to stderr
       -v, --version: print version number to stdout and exit
       -h, --help: print this text to stderr and exit

Expects Piper request messages in either Cap'n Proto or JSON format on stdin,
and writes response messages in the same format to stdout.

This server is intended for simple process separation. It's only suitable for
use with a single trusted client per server invocation.

The two formats behave differently in case of parser errors. JSON messages are
expected one per input line; because the JSON support is really intended for
interactive troubleshooting, any unparseable message is reported and discarded
and the server waits for another message. In contrast, because of the assumption
that the client is trusted and coupled to the server instance, a mangled
Cap'n Proto message causes the server to exit.
