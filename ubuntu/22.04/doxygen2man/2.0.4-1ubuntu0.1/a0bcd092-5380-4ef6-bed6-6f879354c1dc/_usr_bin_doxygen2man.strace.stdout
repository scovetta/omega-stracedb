Usage:
      /usr/bin/doxygen2man [OPTIONS] <XML file>

 This is a tool to generate API manpages from a doxygen-annotated header file.
 First run doxygen on the file and then run this program against the main XML file
 it created and the directory containing the ancilliary files. It will then
 output a lot of *.3 man page files which you can then ship with your library.

 You will need to invoke this program once for each .h file in your library,
 using the name of the generated .xml file. This file will usually be called
 something like <include-file>_8h.xml, eg qbipcs_8h.xml

 If you want HTML output then simply use nroff on the generated files as you
 would do with any other man page.

       -a            Print ASCII dump of man pages to stdout
       -m            Write man page files to <output dir>
       -P            Print PARAMS section
       -g            Print general man page for the whole header file
       -c            Use the Copyright date from the header file (if one can be found)
       -O <dir>      Directory for the original header file. Often needed by -c above
       -s <s>        Write man pages into section <s> (default: 3)
       -p <package>  Use <package> name (default: Package)
       -H <header>   Set header (default: "Programmer's Manual"
       -I <include>  Set include filename (default taken from xml)
       -i <prefix>   Prefix for include files. eg qb/ (nothing by default)
       -C <company>  Company name in copyright (default: "Red Hat")
       -D <date>     Date to print at top of man pages (format not checked, default: today)
       -S <year>     Start year to print at end of copyright line (default: 2010)
       -Y <year>     Year to print at end of copyright line (default: today's year)
       -o <dir>      Write all man pages to <dir> (default: .)
       -d <dir>      Directory for XML files (default: ./xml/)
       -h            Print this usage text
